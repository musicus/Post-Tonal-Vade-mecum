# Post-Tonal ___Vade mecum___
A collection of jupyter notebooks solving post-tonal music theory problems you didn't know you had using python and [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21 "Awesome python library for computational music analyses and computational musicology written by Myke Cuthbert, et al.").
